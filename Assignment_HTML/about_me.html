  <h3>A trip I took</h3>
  A few years ago, I traveled to Bali, Indonesia. It was my first time visiting the island, and I was amazed by the beautiful beaches and the relaxed atmosphere.
  During the trip, I learned how to surf. At first, it was difficult to balance on the board, and I fell into the water many times. But after a few lessons, I could finally ride small waves on my own.
  Surfing in Bali was an unforgettable experience — the warm water, the sound of the waves, and the feeling of standing on the board made me feel free and full of energy.

  <h3>My Favorite pet names</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A cat named Crookshanks (from <i>Harry Potter</i>)</li>
    <li>A horse named Rocinante (from <i>Don Quixote</i>)</li>
    <li>A dog named Karenin (I've been reading <i>Anna Karenina</i>. In <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>, there's a dog named after Karenin, Anna's husband.)</li>
  </ul>

    My favorite food is <b>Peking Duck</b>. The best way to enjoy it is by wrapping thin pancakes around slices of duck, 
    together with scallions and a bit of sweet sauce. 
    The most delicious part of the duck is the crispy breast skin. 
    I like to dip it in sugar — it melts in the mouth and tastes amazing.
